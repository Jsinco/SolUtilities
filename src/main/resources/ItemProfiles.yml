# Use /solace nbtsee to see the NameSpacedKeys of an item (NBT).
# Method checks for Keys first, then Namespace.
# If you don't know what NBT keys are then here is a short explanation: Most Custom use NBT keys to store given data within the item.
# NBT keys always have NameSpaces which can belong to a group of custom items. For example, all the custom items from Solitems have the namespace "solitems".
# If I put a namespace for "solitems" in the list, it would send that specific message for every custom item in solitems that doesn't have it's key in the list.
# A key is a specific NBT key that belongs to a custom item. For example, the key "solitems:custom_item" is a key that belongs to the custom item "custom_item" in the namespace "solitems".
# Placeholders are written exactly how they appear in the config. 'celestial_tier' will return the rgb color code for the Celestial tier.
